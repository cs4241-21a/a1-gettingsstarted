This project shows that I am able to utilize web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JS in order to take an existing template and modify the website to include personal information - as well as show how I explored and used different concepts and features these technologies offer (detailed below).

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: For the body selector, added style rules for font and color. For the h1, h2 selectors, added style rules for color and text alignment. For the li selector, added style rules for color and font-weight. For the a selector, added style rules for color and font style.

- **Experimented with HTML tags**: I used the HTML 'a' tag which defines a hyperlink, linking to a page with the project I worked on during my internship and then linking to a page with the WPI CS course offerings. Added the 'br' tag to serve as a line break and used the 'img' tag to include a picture. I also used the 'marquee' tag for my name. Used the 'hr/' tag to create horizontal lines to divide text sections. Finally I used the 'table', 'td', and 'tr' tags to organize my experience with different technologies. 

### Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette using the Adobe color wheel**: I created a color palette and used all the colors in my webpage (see SawkaColorPalette.png).

- **Used the Montserrat from Google Fonts**: I used the Google font Montserrat as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
