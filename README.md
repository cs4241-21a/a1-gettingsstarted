This project shows Information about me and something I love: Impractical Weezer.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
    -Body: to give the site a background color and default font (mostly for h2)
    -h1: to make the title stand out
    -img: block so that it's on its own line
    -button: to make the button pretty and change the cursor when the mouse goes over it
    -p: give the paragraphs their own color from my pallet
    -.important: made a class for things I want to stand out from the rest
    -.center: Wanted some of it to be in the center so it cathes your eye (also the button looked better in the center)

- **Simple JavaScript animation**:
    -Clicking the button calls a JS function to change a picture to a different picture

- **HTML Tags**:
    -Image
    -button
    -div (so I could make only part of the cite centered)
    -ol (instead of ul so that you could clearly tell who my #1 weezer member was)
    -a (a link to a very funny video)

    -Kaisei HarunoUmi
