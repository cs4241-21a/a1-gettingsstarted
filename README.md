## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added `color` rules to the p, ul, h1, h2, and h3 tags. Added the `word-spacing` rule to the h1 tag to space the words by 10 pixels. Added the `font-family` rule to the h2 tag to use an imported font from Google Fonts. Added the `cursor` rule to the h3 tag to change how the cursor appears on top of the h3 text. Finally, I added a `text-shadow` rule for h3 to drop a black shadow 1 pixel below the text.

### Design Achievements
- **Created and Implemented a Color Palette from Adobe**: I used the Adobe color palette editor to create the color palette with the colors: #FA0DBB, #C30BDE, #9301F5, #500BDE, and #1A0DFA. I used each of them in various html elements on the page. The p tag has #FA0DBB. The ul tag has by default #C30BDE. Every other li element in the ul tag has the color #500BDE. The h1 and h3 tags have the color #9301F5. Finally, the h2 tag has the color #1A0DFA. A screenshot of the color palette I used is included in this repo.
- **Used the Roboto Mono Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto Mono as the font for the h2 tag in my site.
