This project shows my beginning knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I created a website that displays information about me by utilizing different aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technical Achievements
-**Styled page with CSS**: I added rules for body, h1, h2, dl, ul, img, and table. body was styled with both a Google font and background color. h1 and h2 were styled with different text colors as well as different text shadows. dl and ul were styled with a different Google font then the rest of the page. img was resized and table was given a border.
-**Experimented with other HTML tags**: Including img, div, ul, dl, table, and button. I added two images to my website and was able to resize them to adjust to the width of the screen with CSS by using the img rule. I used div containers to separate sections of code and style it differently. I used div classes to label certain parts of tags to then add rules. For example, each section under experience was given a div with class name experience to add a background color in CSS. I also was able to have the two images side by side because I added two different div classes, row and column, which I styled. I added a description list as well as an unordered list to display the WPI classes I have taken and the computer science languages I know. I used a table to show the classes I am currently taking as well as the class I hope to take. I used a button to call upon a Javascript function.
-**Added JavaScript**:I added a Javascript function to be called on when a button is clicked. The function changes the table I had to a line of text.


### Design Achievements
-**Used a color palette**: I used a color palette from color.adobe.com and implemented the 5 colors into my website. I added the colors to the text as well as backgrounds in the CSS.
-**Used the Kaisei HarunoUmi and Montserrat Fonts from Google Fonts**: I used the Kaisei HarunoUmi font from Google Fonts throughout my website by adding it to the CSS rule for body. I also added the Montserrat font for the different kinds of lists I used.
