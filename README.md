## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, li, and a selectors...
I styled the page with the following color scheme:
header: 1186AD
paragraph about course history: #16AEE0
paragraph about planned and current courses: #16AEE0
paragraph about working experience with langauges: #1186AD
included a brand new paragraph called "Hobbies" where an individual can learn more about me: #7CDAFA I initially was styling through padding but I came to understand that this was a bad idea as resizing a page immediately caused issues. I had changed to a more centered approach but I still found it extremely weird with the layout of text present. 

Within my hobbies I include several links from Twitch streamers. These few individuals were extremely helpful to keeping my sanity during isolation last year and remote learning. Seeing friends was difficult and interacting with each of them and their community made it a little more bearable. There are some funny clips that they have on their channels but I was afraid of posting some of them so I opted for their home page instead. 
I used unordered lists quite a bit and at the bottom I include a marquee that takes one of my images and slides it accross the screen in a right to left fashion.
I attempted to include a form that would prompt the user with a message when clicking it, then I realized it can work both ways even if it doesn't. The rats joke is that you never get rid of rats, kind of a NYC thing sadly. I believe this counts towards my JavaScript animation. 
Besides the sliding animation I include several other images. I found importing the images difficult because I could get them working locally but when I went to glitch I found severe issues. So much so that I began restarting from scratch everytime I encountered the issue. Eventually I found the copy button for the links within assests and found my way to solve the problem. An interesting tag that I came across was the break line tag, it was extremely useful for my paragraphs and breaking up large chunks of print. Especially when I wanted them to be on their own line.  


The biggest problem that I experienced during this homework was looking at my screen as I am currently quarantining. They told me all the possible symptoms for covid and the only one I've had recurring was a headache. I was often taking large breaks away from the screen which made it difficult to research what I needed to get done. This isn't an excuse but a true representation of what I was going through this past weekend. 

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
I have included the color pallete from Colors Adobe that I referenced. I like the different hues of blue, they might collide but my philosophy professor once said "How am I supposed to know the exact shade of blue you are seeing. It is just a pigment after all and who is to say I don't see a different pigmentation than you". It was something along those lines and he probably got it from somewhere!
