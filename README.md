This project shows a web page I created to give a little information about me and classes I've taken at WPI so far. I also list some experience that I have with various technologies. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, li, and a selectors...

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
