# Technical Achievements

### I used some extra HTML tags to better format my information
- The `div` tag was used to separate the heading, the list of previous classes, and the
experience. This then allowed me color each section differently using CSS classes
- The `em` tag was used to create a subtitle that was distinct from the rest of the page.
- The `dl`, `dt`, and `dd` tags were used to organize the various technologies and methods
under Experience and my level of experience with each of them.

### I created multiple CSS rules to style my page.
- `body` sets a margin of 0px on all sides so that the background colors
of the other elements reach to the sides of the screen. It also sets a default font and 
font color.
- `h1` and `h2` set the headers to be italic instead of bold. They also make the headers
a different color and set them to be small caps. The only difference between the two
is the font size, with `h2` having the smaller size.
- `em` is used to add emphasis to the major and class year, making it a subtitle for the
first header on the page.
- Each `div` element is used to add a different background color, which is the purpose of
the rules for `.title`, `.courses`, and `.experience`. The rule for `div` provides padding
so that the text inside each div is not up against the left edge of the screen, and so that
the background colors of each div are touching, leaving no white space.
- `dt` is used to italicize each of the technologies/methods in the list, distinguishing them
from the amount of experience specified below.
- The margin in `dd` is used to separate each of the technologies/methods, which makes it a
bit easier to determine which level of experience goes with with technology/method.

# Design Achievements
### I created a color palette from Adobe's color palette creator.
- I was going for some pastel-like colors, and I found Split Complementary to work well
with what I had in mind. This resulted in a few low saturation, high brightness colors
for the background, along with much darker and slightly more saturated colors for the text.
- The picture of the color wheel is in `Color Palette.png`.
