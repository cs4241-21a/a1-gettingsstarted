Jack Sullivan

This is my first project in CS 4241, and it shows that I can do a basic project combining HTML, CSS, and javascript.

## Technical Achievements

- CSS styling:I set rules for `html`, `body`, `h1`, `h2`, `p`, `li`, and `b`. I also defined the classes `.page` and `.centered` to organize my content and make the page more readable.
- Javascript animation: I just made a ball bouncing back and forth within a canvas for this.
- HTML tags: I used `<div>` and `<span>` to organize some stuff
- Image: I put dancing Thanos into my page

## Design Achievements

I only made a color wheel, and I didn't use all the colors since I didn't want to be tacky.
