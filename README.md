This project shows who I am as a student and as a professional. It includes the experience, education, and skills I have accumulated over my career.

### Technical Achievements
- **Mustache templating**: Imported MustacheJS to allow for dynamic component templating. Used this to easily repeat the card and header components.
- **Static file serving**: Improved `server.js` to support static file serving. This allowed for importing additional files for data, styles, 
- **BEM styles**: Styled the website based on BEM formatting guidelines. Styles are split up amongst `styles/global.css`, `styles/theme.css`, `templates/card.mustache`, and `templates/header.mustache`.
- **Animated cursor effect**: Added an animation to create the blinking cursor effect next to *Hello, I'm Nathan*.
- **Tag utilization**: Utilized the  `div`, `pre`, `h1`, `span` HTML tags.
    - `pre` was used to style text like code with Roboto Mono.
    - `h1` was used to mark the primary heading *Hello, I'm Nathan*.
    - `span` was used to change the styling of just *Nathan* in the primary heading.

### Design Achievements
- **Standardized theming**: Created a CSS file at `styles/theme.css` to add a host of CSS variables to standardize stylings across the website.
- **Roboto and Roboto Mono fonts**: Used Roboto and Roboto Mono as the primary and secondary typefaces for the website.
