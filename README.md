Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Glitch

This project shows I'm able to create a simple informative website with simple styling as well. Below are the achievements that detail what style changes I made.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Made the body have a center alignment and changed font size to 1em. Made the list elements not have bullet pointe, gave them a top margin of 0.2em, and a right margin of 2em (to help center them).

- **Experiment with other HTML tags**: I used the details tag to make the lists compactable. The summary tag was to give the details tag a proper name/title.

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the primary font for my site.
