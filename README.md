## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS and JavaScript**: Added rules for the span, h1, h2, p, li, img, and body tags. A JavaScript file was used for timing the image
    fade-ins and text scrolls during the intro of the page.
- **Included images and video**: Added images and a video into the page.
- **Included a text animation**: Added a flame text animation onto the topmost portion of text.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto-Clap and Dancing Script Fonts from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto-Clap as the font for the primary copy text in my site, and
    replaced the header text with the Dancing Script font.
- **Used Javascript to slowly introduce each element of the page**: I used JavaScript and CSS effects/spacing to introduce each element on the page slowly. This consisted of
    introducing the text by having it scroll up from the bottom of the window to the top of the window, then fading the images in once they reached the top.
- **Used CSS to apply a flame/smoke effect to text**: The topmost element of text contains a smoke/flame effect. Source for the effect and timing: https://codepen.io/atnyman/pen/cgGuL/
