This project is a webpage that shows information about myself that would be relevant to this class.
It includes information such as my year, major, previous WPI CS classes, and knowledge of web technologies.

### Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added styles for :root which describes the font, margins.  Added style for body which removes margins/padding and sets background color.  Added background color and font color along w/ padding styles for the header.  Set alignment of the table and set margins to be automatic.  set font-size of table rows.  Set Alternating talbe rows to have a different background color.  Set seperate size for table header font and background color.  Set width of main and margins, along with height.  The alignment of the compoents was difficult so using a variety of margin settings allowed me to make the layout more dynamic.  Automatic margin setting would allow some of the compoents not at full width to be in the middle of the screen.

- **Modified Server to serve files besides index.html**: Updated server.js to serve other local files such as t he style.css.  Takes '/' as the homepage.  This was a small techical challenge since a lot of the changes were shown in class, but I did have to figure out a way to handle a default request ('/').

- **Used a table**: Used a table to describe experience with technology.  This was a useful addition since it allowed organization of this information and did look clustered prior to this change.

### Design Achievements
- **Used a color palatte**: A color palatte I created from adobe which is shown as ColorWheel.png.  This was challenged because I have to find a way to incorporate the yellow/brown colors that looks somewhat natural.  (NOTE:  If the colors look awful, I do apologize I am colorblind so sometimes I miss when it comes to picking colors).

- **Used the Quicksand Font from Google Fonts**: Used Quicksand font from the Google Fonts API as the font for my webpage.  I found this found to be very readable and improve the experience of the webpage.
