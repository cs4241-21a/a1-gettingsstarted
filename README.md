## Technical Achievements
- **Experiment with Other Tags**: Used multiple headers (h1, h2, and h4) as well as link (a href) and style tags.
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body tag, header tags, and link tags (with special conditions on hover). Styled the main text block with a CSS id selector.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Atkinson Hyperlegible font from Google Fonts**: I used Atkinson Hyperlegible, a font designed for extreme accessibility through character differentiation, as my site's body font.
