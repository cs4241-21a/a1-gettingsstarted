Sorry about the lateness,I didn't realize the project was due before class, not 11:59 PM. I know there is no late policy but I hope I can still get some credit for this assignement since it is the first one. 

### Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: I added general rules for to the body to set the background color, font color and font style. 
In addition, I changed the default table style by changing the colors, added borders, and changed the font size and bolded it to 
increase visibility.

- **Experimented with HTML tags**: I added 2 other HTML tags. The first one is a image of myself and the other is a table contain the
previous CS courses I took.

### Design Achievements

- **Used a color palette from colo.adobe.com**: I used a complementary color palette to my website with the 5 colors being different shades of purple and yellow. A image of the color wheel is attached to the repo.
