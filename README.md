## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for h1,h2,h4 as well as p, links (a), li, and tables. I also added the blink style to use. Also made the body background a gradient
- **Experimented with HTML Tags**: Utilized li, tables, span, links (a) and the link tag to customize tab icon.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Source Code Pro Font from Google Fonts**: I used Source Code Pro as the font for the primary text in my site.
- **Used a Compound Colour Scheme from Adobe Color**: See [screenshot](colorScheme.PNG) for the actual colour wheel. Gradient background utlizies one of the colours getting darker.
