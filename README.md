This project shows that I am familiar with web technologies such as HTML and CSS. I modified the starter document to include links (in addition to my personal information). I also created a color palette using the recommended Adobe tool, and styled the page accordingly. Finally, I added the Rampart One font from Google Fonts.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for `body`, `h1`, `h2`, `li`, and `a`
- **Experiment with other HTML tags**: Added the `a` tag

### Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette using the Adobe color wheel**: I created a color palette and used these colors in my styling (see `color-palette.png`)
- **Used the Rampart One font from Google Fonts**: I used Rampart One as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
