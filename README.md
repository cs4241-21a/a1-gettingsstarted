This project demonstrates the use of various html tags, external css styling, and a basic javascript animation in combination with each other to form a dynamic website.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Replaced the bullet points in li with hollow circles and styled the list items, Changed the color of the h1 tag, Changed the color of the h2 tag, Changed the color of the table's background, and gave a border to the cells in the table. Styled the figcaption tag to be grey and in italics.
- **Added a simple JavaScript animation**: animated the color wheel image to slowly expand and contract periodically using javaScript.
- **Experimented with HTML tags**: Used table, th, tr, and td to hold the experience section. Added a link to the experience section in the beginning of the page. Added a picture of the color wheel used. Used the abbr tag to show abbreviations of the acronyms IMGD, and RSA. Used the figure and figcaption tabs to add a caption to the color wheel picture.

### Design Achievements
- **Used a generated color palette**: Generated a color palette from color.adobe.com using green and blue colors in table, h1, h2, td, and li.
- **Used the Helvetica Font from Google Fonts**: I used the Helvetica font from Google fonts as the default font for the entire body of the page.
