This project is a simple webpage giving some minimal information about myself with some (lame) animation and styling.

Also, I'm aware my Github name has "TEMP1" in it. This is due to multiple Github account shenanigans that occurred before I came to WPI. Pay it no heed for now.

## Technical Achievements

- **Styled page with CSS**: Added body and label selectors, as well as my custom some, alot, none, anim, and animcont selectors. Additionally, styling is used in the process of animation.
- **Added animation**: Added box animation to page with Javascript. The box moves until it reaches a certain point, then becomes "lost" and performs a random walk in eight possible directions.
- **Used Additional Tags**: Page includes two different button tags, labels, spans, and a link.

### Design Achievements

- **Used the Allison Font from Google Fonts**: I used Allison as the font for the label text in my site.
- **Used Custom Color Palette from Adobe Color**: I used a color custom palette (screenshot in color palette.png) to format my site's text and background colors.
