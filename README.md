This project shows a simple personal introduction in HTML and styled with CSS. The page is backed by a minimal amount of
NodeJS.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I added rules for text sections to have better spacing between page elements.
- **Used other HTML Tags**: At the moment, my only addition is the link to the rust programming language homepage.

### Design Achievements
- **Use an adobe color palette**: I generated and used a color palette from [color.adobe.com]. ![Color Palette]
- **Used the Open Sans Font from Google Fonts**: I applied the [Open Sans] font to the body section of my page.
