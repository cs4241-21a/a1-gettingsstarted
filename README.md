This project shows a web page I created to give a little information about me and classes I've taken at WPI so far. I also list some experience that I have with various technologies. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**:
    - Added a rule for the h1 selector. This rule made all h1 tags use the font "Bitter" and have a size of 42px. It also made the color of the text a dark green color (#415a4e)

    - Added a rule for the p selector. This rule made all p tags use the font "Lato" and have a size of 14px. It also made all the text within the tag black.

    - Added a rule for the h2 selector. This rule made all h2 tages use the font "Lato" and have a purple color. This color was #5f555a.

    - Added a rule for the li selector. This rule made all text in the li tags use the font "Lato" and have a size of 14px. 

    - Added a rule for the body selector. This rule made all of the content within the body have padding of 20px on all sides. It also set the background color of the page to a cream color (#efeeee).

- **Added a simple JavaScript Animation**
    - The animation is located in the top right corner of the web page. It uses two different pictures of Gompei the goat, one of him in a WPI sweater and the other as an astronaut. I programmed in JavaScript for the images to switch every 5 seconds.

- **Experimented with Different HTML Tags**
    - I used the **img tag** to place the image of Gompei the goat in the top right corner.

    - I used the **hr tag** to place a horizontal line underneath my name before the start of my experience and knowledge.

    - I used the **div tag** to divide up the content of my web page and make my experience and relevant courses appear side by side in the page.

    - I used the **a tag** to embed links within my web page. This made it so I could link my Github account and my LinkedIn profile on my page.

    - I used the **ul tag** to create a bullet list of all the classes I've taken at WPI so far, and also make a bullet list of my experience with other languages and technologies.

    - I used the **script tag** to add an animation to my page that uses JavaScript code.

 
### Design Achievements
- **Created a Color Palette using Adobe**: 
    - My favorite colors are green and purple so I wanted to design a color palette that mainly has those colors. I designed the following color wheel:

- **Used Google Fonts**
    - For my name, I used the Google Font entitled "Bitter"

    - For the rest of the page, I used the Google Font entitled "Lato"
