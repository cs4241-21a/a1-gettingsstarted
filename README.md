This project shows my website created for CS 4241: Webware. Included in it are two html pages. The first, index.html, contains my name, majors, class year, the previous CS courses I have taken at WPI, my experience with specific technologies and methods related to webware, and a couple redirecting links. One link will send the user to a page, paint.html, where the user can draw on the screen with their mouse, pressing keys to toggle colors, and scroll the wheel to increase the stroke width. Paint.html also includes a citation at the bottom launching a new tab to send the user to the website for which paint.html was inspired from, there is also a link back to index.html, called 'Home.' Once back at the bottom of index.html, the other extra link sends the user to a new tab that displays the adobe color palette that is used throughout the website.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I created a few classes of elements to distinguish which sections of my website would have the color of the text changed. I also utilized the table, body and canvas elements along with the #pen id to control the size of the small pen image beside the link to my painting game. I also used a dedicated css style sheet rather than including the style directly into the html.

- **Created a seperate page dedicated to drawing with the mouse**: I wrote paint.js and paint.html to display a second page where the user can draw with the mouse, they can press any key on the keyboard to toggle which of the colors from the adobe color palette I made. The user can also press a button at the top to alternate colors. Using the mouse wheel, the user can increase the width of the stroke from 1-100. Also included is a link to go home and a citation at the bottom refering to the website that I gained inspiration from. Although this is not an animation, I believe that this is similarly complex.

- **Experimented with numerous other html tags**: I used the 'link' tag to refer to my css sheet, and google font. I used the 'button' tag on the paint.html page to toggle the stroke color. I used the 'cite' tag for my citation on paint.html. I used the 'a' tag to create links to the paint.html from index.html and vice versa. I also used the 'a' tag for displaying the adobe color palette in another tab, and for my citation. I used the 'table' tag for displaying my experience with technologies and methods on index.html. I used the 'canvas' tag to allow the user to draw on the paint.html page. WIth 5 tags that would amount to 5 extra points.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Exo Font from Google Fonts**: I imported the font Exo from google fonts and implemented it across my website using the link tag.

- **Created a color palette using color.adobe**: A link to the screenshot is included at the bottom of the website, it will open a new tab to display the image. I used the complimentary color wheel. Each color of the palette was used to color different sections of the text. Each color is also used in the paint.js script that allows the user to toggle what color they can use to paint the screen in paint.html.
