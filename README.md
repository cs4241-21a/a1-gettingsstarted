## Technical Achievements
**Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the  following:
- body: to control the background and text color
- h1: to control heading background and text color, and a border surrounding the heading.
- a:hover:  to change the color when a link is hovered
- ul: to control the borders and bullet styling around the entire table.
- li: to control each individual items border in the table. 

**JavaScript animation**:
I added a JavaScript animation by using an html checkbox and a script written in `script.js` to enable/disable a dark mode. This allows the background to be switched between the adobe color palette or a black background with white text.

**HTML Tags**:
I used the following tags to enhance my website:
- link: This was used two times on the page to link a Google Font and my external stylesheet `style.css`.
- img: This was used to include a picture of myself in my introduction located in the root directory with the filename `mypic.jpg`
- script: This was used to connect my dark mode script to the webpage which is located in the root director with the filename `script.js`
- footer: This was used to place my dark mode checkbox at the bottom of the webpage.
- input: This was used to place a checkbox for the user to interact with to enable/disable dark mode.
