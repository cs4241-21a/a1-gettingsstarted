This project contains a page with some basic information about myself. This includes my majors, class year, previous cs classes, and experience with some technologies related to this class. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS** 
  - Added rules (in [index.css](index.css)) for styling the body, li, table, and td tags in order to color them, fix spacing, and make my course list fancier than a normal ul.
  - I also styled my "exp_bar" class and the "none", "some", and "lots" classes, allowing me to make fancier experience bars instead of simple text.

- **Added a JavaScript animation**
  - Used JavaScript (in [index.js](index.js)) to fade in elements one by one on page load.

- **Added routes for index.css and index.js in server.js**
  - I added routes for the index.css and index.js files in the server in order for them to load correctly.

- **Used extra HTML tags**
  - I utilized the table, tr, and td tags to organize the "technologies" panel. This also made it easier to align everything neatly.

### Design Achievements
- **Used a palette made with [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com)**
  - I used the color palette shown below to color the background and experience bars on my page.<br>![Color Wheel](color_wheel.png)

- **Used the Ubuntu font from Google Fonts**
  - I used the [Ubuntu font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu) for all of the text on my page.
