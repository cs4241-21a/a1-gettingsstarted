## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: In addition to changing various color, background colors and text sizes I used CSS to create the scrolling parallax effect at the top of the website. Additionally I rounded the mute button and added hover effects, in the first text I have I used a font varient to achieve the small-caps and at the bottom of the page I used CSS to change the color of hyperlinks
- **Add a simple JavaScrip animation to page**: At the bottom of the page you can find a bouncing DVD image that I created from two elements and animated using JavaScript. Additionally I added a button to toggle the sound and utilized that button in changing the text it displays as well. 
- **Experiment with HTML tags** Some additional tags I added were <hr> for line breaks, images, table for skills, link (to top of page), button (toggle mutting), and <div> to help formating and create the boxes for animation

### Design Achievements
- **Used Pacifico Font from Google Fonts**: I used Pacifico font for my Name and Year at the top of my site
- **Create and use a Color Palette from adobe**: I uploaded the gif at the top of my website to match colors from it to create the color palette for the rest of my website. The color palette used is provided at the bottom of the page.
