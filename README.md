This project shows a website detailing some information about myself and some of my experience.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added CSS with the tags h1, p, p2, h2, and li to adjust the colors of the text and the background color for body. For h1 and h2, added a text shadow. For p2, the text was bolded.

## Design Achievements
- **Created an adobe color palette**: Used adobe to create a color palette (image of the color palette is the image labeled a1-palette.png in the main directory) and implemented those colors.
- **Used a font from Google**: Used the font "Nanum Gothic" for all the text on the page.
