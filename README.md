This project shows the creation of my website that introduces myself through the use of HTML and CSS. I have added a Google Font (Hina Mincho) as well as a color palette from Adobe which I provided a screenshot in this repo. 

Technical Achievements:

1. Style the page using CSS: 
    - Changed the font for the body of the website to the Google font (Hina Mincho) and font size to 20px. 
    - Added an identifier (paratitle) for certain paragraphs that changes the text color (#02427A) and the font size to 25px.
    - Added an identifier (headcolor) for the headings that changes the text color (#01203B).
    - Changed the listed items (li) text color (#0588FA) and text size to 5px.
    - Changed the text color for links if they are visited, hovered, and active. 

2. Other HTML tags: 
    - Added <link> tag to provide the Google font
    - Added <a> tag to provide YouTube links to music I've listened to
    - Added <br> tag to have each link start on a new line
    - Added <figure> tag to provide an image as well as a caption
    - Added <img> tag to provide an image of my favorite meme
    - Added <figcaption> tag to provide context of what the image is
