This project was intended to introduce/reinforce development using Git, GitHub, and Glitch, as well as to begin working with HTML. The project goal was to create a site by editing a given index.html file to include some simple information about ourselves including class year, courses taken, work experience, etc... 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p (created a new class called p.quote), body, h1, h2, and div selectors. These rules include changing the color of text, background color of page, background color of text, aligining text, font, and font-size. Something that was a little challenging was trying to center the lists to the middle of the page but also having the bullet points line up. To solve this I wrapped the ul tags with a div tag that had rules applied to line up the bullet points.  
- **Used other HTML tags**: I experimented with additional HTML tags such as links (bringing you to my GitHub and LinkedIn), images (soccer team logo and picture of myself), buttons (click button for image to appear), and I also worked with different sized headers (h1, h2, and h3). 
- **Created simple script to program button click**: I created a simple function in JS such that when the button on the site is clicked, an image of a logo will appear. The style.display of the image is initially set to 'none' which means the image is hidden, and then once the button is clicked it will change it to 'block' making it visible. 

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Dancing Script Font from Google Fonts**: I used Dancing Script as the font for the quote at the bottom of the site.
- **Created a color palette using Adobe**: You can find a screenshot of the palette inside this repository, named "a1-ColorPalette". I used all the colors that were in my color palette for different aspects of the site such as body background color, body text color, title text color, quote text color, etc...
