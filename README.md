This project shows some basic usages of git, GitHub, Glitch, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1, h2, p, ul, table, th, td, img, container, animation and button elements.
For most elements (body, h1, h2, p, ul, table) these rules include background colors. For body, h1 and h2 they also include fonts. For h1, h2, ul and table they include width. For ul they also include padding. For img and button they include alignment, width and height. Container and animation are used to create the small javascript animation which will be described shortly.

- **Added simple JavaScript animation**: when clicking on the button labeled "Start animation", a small JavaScript animation will play where the smaller yellow square will move diagonally inside the bigger red square. To achieve the animation, the container and animation elements were used.

- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: Aside from the already provided tags "table, thead, tbody, tr, th, td, div, script, a, img and button tags were used
There were three different kinds of <li> tags used
1) The <a> tag used for the github link is a from-website-to-website link. Meaning it leads from my website to github
2) The <a> tag used for the email link is an email tag
3) The <a> tag at the bottom of the webpage allows for navigation within my website (it uses a relative URL) 

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Bebas Neue Font from Google Fonts**: I used Bebas Neue as the font for the header (<h1> and <h2>) text in my site.

- **Created and used a color palette from color.adobe.com**: I used all 5 colors in the color palette for background of the <body>, <h1>, <h2>, <p> and <table> elements. The screenshot of the color palette is provided inside the images folder.
