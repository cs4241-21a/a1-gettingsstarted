    I am a computer science major (class of 2022!)
  </p>
  <p>
    I like to take naps, bake, and ride my Peleton. At WPI I am involved in Alpha Xi Delta as a sister and spirit chair
    and I am also a Rho Gamma for recruitment this year.

    Working experience

    The past summer I was an Java dev at Broadridge for my internship. I worked in Angular/CSS/HTML over the summer so I
    am pretty comfortable with it.
    We ran via Tomcat/Maven so I have working experience within that as well.
