      Hey! 
      <br>  
      My name is Michael but most people call me by my last name, Zeolla. 
      <br>
      I am a Junior currently attending WPI with an intended graudation year of 2023.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class = "medium textColor">
      
      
        I am a software engineer with extensive domain knowledge in the mobile industry. 
        Experienced in Java, Kotlin, C, C++, Python, JavaScript and Android development. 
        I am passionate about developing products and services that will have a positive impact in everyday life.
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition to my academic work, I have always enjoyed building and creating software that fulfills some purpose for others. 
        To this end, I have worked on and built numerous side projects each with the goal of creating software that could benefit people in their everyday lives.
        For example, Task Train, which was a side project focused on creating an advanced Todo app with alarm clock functionality, was purely inspired by my difficulty managing time.
