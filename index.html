      Hi! My name is Kiara Munz and I am majoring in computer science, minoring in IMGD, and hoping to graduate in 2023! I have been a moderately avid coder since freshman year of high school, so I have encountered a wide variety of code related things in my travels :) Outside of the coding world, I like neon colors, craft projects, and video games!
    </p>

      As a junior, I have also completed a lot of WPI classes: CS 1102 (Accelerated Racket), CS 2103 (Accelerated OO Design), CS 2303 (C & C++), CS 2022 (Discrete Math), CS 2223 (Algorithmns), CS 3133 (Foundations: Little Computer Logic Puzzles), CS 3733 (Software Engineering), CS 3431 (Databases 1), CS 2011 (Assembly), and CS 546 (Grad Human Computer Interaction). I also completed IMGD 1000 and IMGD 1001, which are both game design courses that heavily focus on user-centered design for both digital and tabletop environments!
